### Tonight’s keynote in a nutshell
Microsoft Build 2025 kicks off at 8:45 a.m. PT (11:45 p.m. CET) with a two-hour stream led by Satya Nadella and an agenda dominated by AI: bigger Copilot roll-outs, agent interoperability via the new Model Context Protocol (MCP), Recall-enabled Windows 11 updates, fresh Azure AI tooling, and a possible tease of the ASUS-built “Project Kennan” Xbox handheld. 

### Copilot everywhere
Microsoft’s flagship assistant is expected to gain semantic search inside Settings, File Explorer and the Windows search bar, plus the first Copilot Agents—pre-built avatars (think a modern Clippy) that can run multi-step tasks without further prompting. 
For developers, Copilot APIs will surface in GitHub and Power Platform sessions, while Microsoft hints at an in-house LLM that could eventually replace OpenAI models inside Copilot, a move that would give Redmond tighter cost and privacy controls. 


### From chatbots to agents: the MCP standard
CTO Kevin Scott will demo the open-source Model Context Protocol, backed by Anthropic and now Microsoft, letting agents from different vendors share memory and tools much like web pages share hyperlinks—paving the way for an “agentic web.” 
Expect live coding sessions that show how to spin up an MCP server in C# and plug it into Copilot or VS Code. 


### Windows 11 tuned for AI PCs
Build should confirm wider availability of the controversial Recall feature—which snapshots your screen and lets Copilot fetch past context—plus new on-device small-language-model perks like Click-to-Do text actions. 
Microsoft is unlikely to announce Windows 12; the focus remains on making 11 the default OS for neural-accelerated “Copilot+” laptops shipping this summer. 

### Azure & enterprise AI stacks
Azure sessions will preview an overhauled Azure Migrate experience (application-aware moves, carbon-savings metrics) and easier deployment of fine-tuned models through Azure AI Studio, positioning Azure as the go-to host for agent workloads.
